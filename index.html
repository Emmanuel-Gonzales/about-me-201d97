        <h2>Biography</h2>
          <p>
            I am from Cleveland, OH which is located in the Midwest of the United States. 
            I come from a large family with 6 siblings where I am the oldest girl. 
            I have a small family consisting of only me, my husband, and our daughter.

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
          I graduated High School way back in 2007 to a local public school. 
          (This High School's football team recently won the 2022 State Championship; Go Tarblooders!) 
          After graduation, I went on to attend college where I changed my major basically every semester. 
          This is how I found myself as a Computer Science major and took my first coding class with C++. 
          I wasn't disciplined and mature enough to continue with the major so I eventually changed it back to Criminology. 
          I abruptly left college in 2012 with only 5 classes until graduation. 
          I eventually went back to school in 2016 where I took a semester and finished those five classes to earn my BA in Criminology.
