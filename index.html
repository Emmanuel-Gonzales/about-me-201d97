        <h2>Biography</h2>
          <p>
            I am from Cleveland, OH which is located in the Midwest of the United States. 
            I come from a large family with 6 siblings where I am the oldest girl. 
            I have a small family consisting of only me, my husband, and our daughter.

        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>
          I graduated High School way back in 2007 to a local public school.  
          (This High School's football team recently won the 2022 State Championship; Go Tarblooders!)
          After graduation, I went on to attend college where I changed my major basically every semester. 
          This is how I found myself as a Computer Science major and took my first coding class with C++. 
          I wasn't disciplined and mature enough to continue with the major so I eventually changed it back to Criminology. 
          I abruptly left college in 2012 with only 5 classes until graduation. 
          I eventually went back to school in 2016 where I took a semester and finished those five classes to earn my BA in Criminology.
          I also took a boot camp where I was prepped to take and pass the CompTIA Security + and AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate certifications.

        <h2>Job Experience</h2>
          <p>
            While in school, I worked various odd jobs to make ends meet as a college student.
            My first real experience I have working 40+ hours a week (without overtime) is the Navy. 
            I worked as an aircraft electrician. I learned leadership, how to troubleshoot, perform maintenance, and a host of other skills.
            When I got out the Navy, I wanted to work in the field of my degree but I did not have it in my heart to work in public service.
            I wanted to work smart and not hard. I worked hard enough in the military.
            After I got my certifications, I got a job at a help desk where I still troubleshoot computer issues, reset passwords, and conduct software coaching.

        <p>
          I have an ultimate goal of working with Web3 and Blockchain Development but first I must learn to code first!
