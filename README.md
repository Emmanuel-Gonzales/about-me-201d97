### Comments

Overall this project went well. I took a lot of time on CSS and trying to make it look like something. I do not have any questions right now. The assignment took me 5 hours to do when I could get it done in 2 hours. I need more work on my CSS skills. I spent A LOT of time on CSS with some mental breaks in between.
